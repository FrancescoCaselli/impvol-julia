Solving a simple Armington-endowment model.

Let $Q_n = A_NL_n$, with $L_n$ completely inelastic. Demand is CES:
\[
C_n^{1-1/\theta} = \sum_m Q_m^{1-1/\theta}.
\]
Trade costs are $\tau_{ij}$ and we denote $\kappa_{ij} = \tau_{ij}^{-\theta}$.

This model has the following equilibrium equations.
\[
d_{nm} = 
	\frac
	{(\tau_{nm}w_m)^{1-\theta}}
	{\sum_k (\tau_{nk} w_k)^{1-\theta}}
\]
\[
w_m \cdot L_m = \sum_n d_{nm} w_n \cdot L_n
\]
where $w_m$ is the unit cost of labor $L_m$.
\[
w_m L_m = w_m^{1-\theta}
\sum_n 	\frac
	{\tau_{nm}^{1-\theta}}
	{\sum_k (\tau_{nk} w_k)^{1-\theta}}
 w_n L_n
\]
Let $\Phi_n = \sum_k (\tau_{nk} w_k)^{1-\theta}$ 
\[
w_m^\theta L_m = 
\sum_n 	
	{\tau_{nm}^{1-\theta}}
 w_n L_n/\Phi_n.
\]
This leads to a better iteration: Pick $w_n$ and calculate corresponding $\Phi_n$. Calculate new $w_n$ from LHS. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pick $\alpha_m^{(0)} = w_mL_m/\Phi_m$ from some previous equilibrium (or data).
	\item Solve for
	\[
	w_m^{(k+1)} = L_m^{-1/\theta} 
		\left[
		\sum_n \alpha_n^{(k)} \tau_{nm}^{1-\theta}
		\right]^{1/\theta}
	\]
	\item Set 
	\[
	\alpha_m^{(k+1)} = w_m^{(k)} L_m/\Phi_m(w^{(k)})
	\]
	and repeat.
\end{enumerate}
This should converge fast, in 3-4 steps, because (i) we start from a close guess, (ii) $\theta$ is large so that $1/\theta$ is small, resulting in dampening, (iii) $\alpha$ has limited impact on wages, only due to destination-country variation in $\tau$, dampening feedback.
